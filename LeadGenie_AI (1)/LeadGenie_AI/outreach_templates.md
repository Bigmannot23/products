Hey {Name},
Saw your post about wanting to scale client outreach without sounding spammy. I built **LeadGenie AI** for exactly that — it generates personalised messages at scale with optional research enrichment and multiple tones.
I'd love to give you a demo and early‑bird pricing if you're interested!
Best,

These templates strike a balance between empathy (acknowledging the pain) and excitement (showing the solution). Always personalise and avoid spamming large groups.
