## Outreach Templates – Promoting GigNavigator AI

Below are example messages you can use to reach out to prospective users.  Personalise them with the recipient’s name and context.

### LinkedIn DM to a Freelancer

> **Hey {Name},**
>
> I noticed you mentioned struggling to find good clients off platforms.  I felt that pain too – which is why I built **GigNavigator AI**.  It’s basically an AI that scans LinkedIn, job boards and communities for freelance gigs tailored to you, and even drafts your pitches.  A few early users are already landing new projects with it.
>
> If you’re interested, I’d love to get you early access (with a nice discount) and hear your feedback.  No pressure – just thought it might save you a ton of time.
>
> Cheers,
>
> **{Your Name}**

### Email to Existing Customers (ApplyMate/LeadGenie Buyers)

Subject: *New AI tool to end your freelance client dry spells*

> **Hi {Name},**
>
> As someone who’s invested in my AI tools, you know I’m all about making freelance life easier.  I’m excited to share my newest tool: **GigNavigator AI**.  Remember how ApplyMate helped with job applications?  This does the same for freelance gigs – it hunts down quality contracts from across the web for you.  No more refreshing Upwork (which, let’s face it, is getting worse).  Early users are calling it a **game‑changer for finding clients**.
>
> I’d love for you to try it out and let me know what you think.  As a thank‑you for your past support, here’s a **30% off launch coupon: EARLYBIRD30**.
>
> Happy freelancing!
>
> **Alex (Bigmannot23)**

These templates strike a balance between empathy (acknowledging the pain) and excitement (showing the solution).  Always personalise and avoid spamming large groups.
