## Demo Script – GigNavigator AI

Use this script to record a short demo video or GIF for your product page or launch announcement.  It highlights the core workflow and differentiators of GigNavigator AI.

1. **Introduce the pain.**
   - Show a freelancer refreshing Upwork with dozens of proposals already sent and no bites.
   - Narrate: “Meet Jane, a talented freelancer lost in the crowd.  She’s sent dozens of proposals with no luck – clients just aren’t seeing her.”

2. **Launch GigNavigator.**
   - Cut to Jane opening the GigNavigator AI application.  She clicks **Scan Now** in the sidebar.
   - Narrate: “With one click, GigNavigator scans the entire web for quality freelance gigs.  LinkedIn, company boards, niche communities – all the places great clients post.”

3. **Display results.**
   - Show the dashboard populating with leads from multiple sources, each with a match score and highlights.
   - Narrate: “In seconds, Jane sees 5 new opportunities curated for her.  The AI read every post and rated the match.  See that 88%?  It’s a project that matches her skills and even mentions her favourite tool.”

4. **Drill into a lead.**
   - Click on the top result to open the details view.  Show the concise summary, extracted keywords and salary range.
   - Narrate: “She opens the details – the long job description is distilled into key points.  No more guesswork or wasted time reading walls of text.”

5. **Generate a proposal.**
   - Click **Generate Proposal** (or **Generate DM**) for that lead.  Show the text area populating with a tailored message.
   - Narrate: “Now for the magic – she clicks Generate Proposal.  A tailored cover letter is ready to go, highlighting exactly why she’s perfect for this gig.  She downloads it and submits her application – all in a few minutes.”

6. **Show real‑time alerts.**
   - Display a small toast notification: “New lead: Marketing agency needs freelance designer – 92% match!”
   - Narrate: “GigNavigator works in the background too.  An alert pops up – another high‑match gig was just posted.  Because she’s one of the first to respond, Jane already stands out from the crowd.”

7. **Outcome.**
   - Cut to Jane’s inbox with replies and interview requests coming in.
   - Narrate: “Instead of wondering if she’ll have work next month, Jane is now juggling multiple client calls.  The good kind of problem!  She’s reclaimed hours of job hunting time and turned them into billable client work.”

8. **Closing.**
   - Show the product logo and tagline: “GigNavigator AI – Let AI find your next freelance gig, while you focus on what you do best.”

Use concise voiceover and on‑screen text callouts to emphasise the benefits.  Keep the video under two minutes to maintain viewer attention.
