   *Show a user overwhelmed by the manual process the product solves.*
   Narrate the pain point and why it matters.

2. Launch the app.
   *Cut to the user opening the application and clicking the main action (e.g., Generate, Scan or Create).*
   Narrate how the tool pulls in the necessary data and prepares to generate results.

3. Display results.
   *Show the dashboard populating with output: scores, messages or proposals.*
   Narrate how quickly the AI produces high‑quality content tailored to the user’s needs.

4. Take action.
   *Click a call‑to‑action button (e.g., Generate Cover Letter, Send DM, Download Proposal) and show the resulting document or message.*
   Narrate how the user can export or copy the content with one click.

5. Outcome.
   *End with the user saving time and achieving their goal (landing interviews, booking meetings, closing projects).*
   Narrate the benefits and invite viewers to try the product.

Keep the video under two minutes. Use concise voiceover and on‑screen text to emphasise the benefits.
