ApplyMateÂ AI is a local Streamlit application that helps you land your dream job by automating resume parsing, job description analysis and coverâ€‘letter generation. It scores how well your resume matches each job, suggests tailored improvements and even prepares interview Q&A and LinkedIn profile tweaks â€” all running locally on your machine.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Resume Parser** â€“ Upload a PDF/DOCX or paste your resume to extract the plain text for analysis.
- **Job Description Analyzer** â€“ Paste multiple job descriptions at once and extract keywords and required skills.
- **Match Scoring & Keywords** â€“ See a percentage match score and a list of matching keywords for every job.
- **Coverâ€‘Letter Generator** â€“ Draft personalized cover letters using GPTâ€‘powered prompts. Choose from Professional, Friendly, Technical or Creative tones â€” or supply your own.
- **Resume Suggestion Engine** â€“ Get targeted suggestions to tweak your resume for better ATS & recruiter alignment.
- **Interview Q&A Generator** â€“ Receive likely interview questions with model answers tailored to your experience.
- **LinkedIn Optimizer** â€“ Analyse your resume and propose improvements to your LinkedIn headline and summary.
- **Batch Mode** â€“ Process multiple job descriptions in one run and export all letters and Q&A in Markdown, PDF or DOCX.

Everything runs locally and your resume data remains private. The app supports English, Spanish, French and German.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. Ensure you have **PythonÂ 3.9 or higher** installed.  
2. Install the core dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   For DOCX and PDF export support, install the full set of optional dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-full.txt
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your OpenAI API key:

   ```ini
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
   ```

4. Run the app locally with Streamlit:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. Use the sidebar to choose your language and whether youâ€™re working on a single application or batch mode. Upload your resume, paste job descriptions, select a tone and click **Generate**.

### Troubleshooting & Tips

- If the sidebar warns that no API key is configured, add your key to a `.env` file. Without a key the app will use template responses.
- Install `python-docx` for Word export and `matplotlib` for PDF export.
- Ensure your CSV includes required columns (`job_title, description`) when using batch mode.
