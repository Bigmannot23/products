LeadGenieÂ AI is a local Streamlit application that helps you craft personalized coldâ€‘outreach messages at scale. Whether youâ€™re sending a single note or a mail merge to hundreds of leads, LeadGenie guides you through template selection, optional research enrichment, tone selection and multiâ€‘channel copy generation â€” all in your preferred language.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Single & Bulk Mode** â€“ Generate a message for one lead or upload a CSV of hundreds of leads and download a mailâ€‘mergeâ€‘ready file.
- **AI Research Assist** â€“ Optionally enrich your message with a company tagline, recent press or social posts (stubbed; plug in your own APIs).
- **Template Library** â€“ Five proven outreach templates (book a call, audit offer, direct pitch, free resource, networking) editable in the `/templates` folder.
- **Tone/Persona Switcher** â€“ Choose from Friendly, Formal, SaaS Founder, Copywriter or define your own tone.
- **Multiâ€‘Channel Output** â€“ Generate copy tailored for Email, LinkedIn DM, Twitter DM and Upwork.
- **Followâ€‘Up Sequence** â€“ Generate up to three followâ€‘up messages per lead to continue the conversation.
- **Exports & CRM Ready** â€“ Download messages as TXT/MD/PDF/DOCX for individual leads or as a CSV (Notionâ€‘ready template included) for bulk sends.
- **Multilingual UI** â€“ Switch between English, EspaÃ±ol, FranÃ§ais and Deutsch from the sidebar.

Your data stays local â€” only your OpenAI API key is used for generation, and you can easily plug in your own data enrichment.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. Ensure you have **PythonÂ 3.9 or higher** installed.  
2. Install the core dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   For DOCX and PDF export support, install the full set of optional dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-full.txt
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your OpenAI API key:

   ```ini
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
   ```

4. Run the app locally with Streamlit:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. In Single Mode, fill out the lead details, choose a template, tone and channels, then click **Generate messages**. In Bulk Mode, upload a CSV with columns `name,company,job_link,angle` and download your CSV of generated messages.

### Troubleshooting & Tips

- If the sidebar warns that the API key is missing, ensure your `.env` contains a valid `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Without a key the app falls back to deterministic templates.
- Install `python-docx` for Word export and `matplotlib` for PDF export.  A Notion CRM template CSV is located in `/assets`.
- When using bulk mode, ensure your CSV contains the required columns and is properly formatted.
