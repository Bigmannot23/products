If you'd like to try it out (with an early adopter discount), let me know and I'll send you a link.
Cheers,

ðŸŽ‰ Just launched **ProposalPalÂ AI**! It writes full proposals from your client briefs â€” or use our editable templates. Formal, friendly or persuasive tones, PDF/DOCX/Markdown export and completely offline. DM me for a launch discount!

These templates strike a balance between empathy (acknowledging the pain) and excitement (showing the solution). Always personalise and avoid spamming large groups.
